## Exchange Arbitrage
At times you will see the same asset trading at different prices on exchanges.
For instance, on Coinbase Pro you will often see the best ask price for ETH trading
at 238.89 while on FTX the best ask price for ETH will be trading at 238.81; a .08 spread.
This means you can instantly buy ETH on Coinbase Pro for cheaper price and instantly sell ETH
on FTX for a higher price earning .08 on the trade. Yes, it's a small return, but if you simulate this
trade 1000 times it will begin to add up, netting you 80. Do this every day for the year and you could earn
a return of $29,200 - not bad.
